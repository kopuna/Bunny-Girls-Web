To create a new girl just copy one of the existing html file in the `./views/ourGirls/girls` folder.
Change the appearances and filename to the name of the new girl. Everythin in lower case except in the title.
Then copy one of the js files in the `./js folder`. Also rename the file and every other appearance of the old girls name to the new one again in lower case except the `girl.name` one.
Then just change the metadata in the girl object in that file to the data for the new girl.
And put images as png in the `./assets` folder and name them like the name of the girl in lower case. `<girlname>.png` Name the pictures of their head `<girlname>Head.png`
