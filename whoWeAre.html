        <h1>Who we are</h1>
        <p>
            Bunny Girls is a project made by Toki whose purpose is to eliminate every man alive.<br>
            We believe that men are an inferior being on earth. They only think about sex and have been the dominating ones for so long.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we donâ€™t need them (because of artificial procreation), we believe that the best we can do is eradicate them. 
            But we are not monsters! We know what men like, and in order to make the world a better place without wars, we are offering men the possibility to be eradicated by a beautiful girl in a way they will enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a man, you can choose a girl, and you will be killed by her in a very erotic way! Of course, we are not giving any sex to men, 
            but there are a lot of fetishes that can be enjoyed while dying. Now that we have the technology to shrink men down to 3 inches, 
            you will have fun in your last moments and make the world a better place.
